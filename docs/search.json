Following data collection, each scan was exported as an .obj file, which includes a bitmap image of the surface color of each vessel. Images were subsequently transferred to a transparent background in Photoshop in preparation for analysis using the colordistance package in R (R Core Development Team, 2023; Weller and Westneat 2019). Upper and lower limits of the color range were determined based on colors present in the sample. Ten thousand randomly selected pixels were plotted from each image, a histogram binning method was used to group similar colors for each specimen, and pairwise distances between histograms were computed using earth mover’s distance (Rubner and Tomasi 2001; Weller and Westneat 2019).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/fig2.png')\n\n\n\n\nColor binning process for a single object; adapted from Weller and Westneat (2019:Figure 2).

Those data were used in a permutational multivariate analysis of variance in the vegan package to evaluate whether vessel color differs by firing method (permutations: 10,000; Rsq: 0.4342; Pr(>F): 9.999e-05).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/fig3.png')\n\n\n\n\nNeighbor-joining tree illustrating the 3D texture (color) data for oxidized (left) and reduced (right) Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain Caddo bottles."

    "text": "Geography\nCoordinate data were subsequently harvested and joined with the categorical dataset, and all data were imported to a GIS for a distribution analysis to identify core production areas. The GIS environment was modified to ensure that both distributions (oxidized and reduced) would share the same extent, defined by the distribution of all sites in the sample. The distribution of sites serves as a proxy for the distribution of the two types (Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain), where a minimum convex polygon could be fitted to those data as a means of delimiting their utilization distribution (sensu Worton 1989). Within that utilization distribution, core production areas were defined using kernel density, where raster values from the location of each site were subsequently exported to identify the 50 and 75 percent quantiles. Each raster was reclassified using three classifications; the darkest indicating the 50 percent quantile, another lighter color at 75, and a third—transparent—holding the remainder. Results demonstrate a single core area related to the production of reduced bottles; however, oxidized bottle production occurred across two core areas (one north; the other south). All core production areas occur in the Red River Basin inside the ancestral Caddo area.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/geo.jpg')\n\n\n\n\nKernel densities representing the 50 (black) and 75 percent (gray) quantiles for reduced bottles, and the 50 (dark brown) and 75 percent (light brown) quantiles for the oxidized bottles."

    "text": "Morphology\nLandmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Bookstein et al. 1999; Gunz, Mitteroecker, and Bookstein 2005; Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Bookstein 1986; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Rohlf 1999) in R using the geomorph and RRPP packages (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018; Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each bottle using unit-centroid size—the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid (Chapman 1990; Dryden and Mardia 1998; Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Dryden and Mardia 1993; Kent and Mardia 2001; Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).\nPrincipal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualize shape variation among the bottles, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space (Adams, Rohlf, and Slice 2013; Bookstein 1991; O’Higgins and Jones 1998; Rohlf and Marcus 1993). Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/fig4.png')\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal components analysis plot (PC1/PC2) for Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles by firing category, where gray circles indicate bottles fired in a reduced environment, and orange plus signs indicate those from an oxidized environment; warp grids for the first two principal components.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess whether shape and size differs by ColorGroup, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/fig5.png')\n\n\n\n\nMean shapes summarizing variation in Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles fired in oxidized (left) and reduced (right) environments.

In the analysis of bottle morphology by firing method, vessels were found to differ in shape (RRPP: 10,000; Rsq: 0.11456; Pr(>F): 0.0275), but not size (RRPP: 10,000; Rsq: 0.00224; Pr(>F): 0.8008)."

    "text": "Summary of results\nThis study used a quantitative analysis of 3D vessel color to demarcate oxidized and reduced Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles, demonstrating a methodologically rigorous and reproducible approach to categorizing continuous variables associated with color. Bottles in each group were found to differ in shape, but not size, and while two core production areas are associated with oxidized firing, only one core production area was associated with reduction firing. While ancillary to the primary research question, a morphological comparison of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles was included in this analysis. Similarities in shape between the two types are known—and demonstrated here—however, what was not known is that Hickory Engraved bottles are significantly larger. This difference in volume may translate to difference in the function of these two bottle types.\nThese findings provide evidence for two discrete, contemporary, and sympatric Caddo potting communities delimited by macroscopic production attributes, where differential production-based intentions among Caddo potters can be posited. While spatial overlap occurs between the core production areas associated with oxidized and reduced firing in the north, the southern core production area is geographically isolated. This served as the impetus for asking whether extant morphological differences may be apparent between the two core production areas for bottles fired in an oxidized environment.\nUsing only those vessels recovered from sites in the core production areas, it was demonstrated that the oxidized and reduced bottles in the north are similar, and that the northern bottles differ significantly in shape when compared with bottles recovered in the south. Elsewhere it has been demonstrated that morphological differences exist between ceramics (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021), bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), and arrow points (Selden Jr. and Dockall 2023; Selden Jr. 2023; Selden Jr. et al. 2021) recovered from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions; a theory to which this effort contributes adds further support. These two communities of practice (morphology + firing) can be concatenated as a means of positing the possible provenance, or, at minimum, the locus of influence with regard to manufacture, associated with Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles found outside of the three core production areas identified above. In such cases, simple visual assessments of bottle shape can be used to discriminate between the northern and southern manufacturing traditions, while an assessment of firing method will discriminate—among the northern production areas—between eastern (reduced) and western (oxidized) firing traditions."

The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Dryden and Mardia 1993; Kent and Mardia 2001; Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).\nPrincipal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualize shape variation among the bottles, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space (Adams, Rohlf, and Slice 2013; Bookstein 1991; O’Higgins and Jones 1998; Rohlf and Marcus 1993).
