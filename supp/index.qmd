>Each [Caddo] clan had its own shape to make its pottery. One clan never thought of making anything the same pattern of another clan. **_You could tell who made the pottery by the shape_** [@RN9357x, 395].

# Basis of inquiry

Color is afforded primacy in ceramic production inquiries, as it provides evidence linked with use, raw material variability, and method of firing. This study focuses on the latter, and asks whether Caddo potters conditioned the morphology of bottles based on the method by which they intended to fire them. Thirty three-dimensional (3D) scans of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles were collected from five museums and repositories, and provide 360-degree coverage of exterior colors associated with each vessel. Texture (color) files were used in a quantitative analysis of color where vessels were subsequently binned into two groups based on firing method; oxidized and reduced. A geographic information system was subsequently used to identify core production areas associated each firing method, and 3D meshes were analyzed using the tools of geometric morphometrics to assess whether bottle shape and size differ by method of firing. Results demonstrate a single core production area for the reduced bottles, and two---one north; the other, south---for oxidized bottles, as well as significant differences in both color and bottle shape, but not size, by firing method. A subsequent analysis was limited to bottles from the three core production areas, and demonstrated a significant difference in shape between the northern and southern oxidized bottles, but no difference in shape was found between the northern oxidized and reduced firing groups. Thus, Formative/Early Caddo potters conditioned the shape of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles based on their geography of production or influence, and not the intended firing method. This finding yields evidence for discrete, contemporary, and sympatric Caddo potting communities delimited by macroscopic production attributes, and advances our understanding of Caddo decision-making behaviors related to bottle production.

## Firing

Each of the 30 vessels was scanned (3D) with a Creaform GoSCAN20 to capture color and geometry. Following data collection, each scan was exported as an .obj file, which includes a bitmap image of the surface color of each vessel. Images were subsequently transferred to a transparent background in Photoshop in preparation for analysis using the `colordistance` package in R [@R;@RN11200]. Upper and lower limits of the color range were determined based on colors present in the sample. Ten thousand randomly selected pixels were plotted from each image, a histogram binning method was used to group similar colors for each specimen, and pairwise distances between histograms were computed using earth mover’s distance [@RN11201;@RN11200].

```{r fig2, fig.cap="Color binning process for a single object; adapted from Weller and Westneat (2019:Figure 2). In a, image of a Smithport Plain bottle with a transparent background; b, 3D scatterplot of 10,000 non-background pixels in RGB color space; c, clusters from histogram displayed in RGB color space; and d, histogram showing the proportion of non-background pixels assigned to each bin."}

```

The bottles were coded as ColorGroup A (reduced) and ColorGroup B (oxidized) using the output from a neighbor-joining tree, calculated using the color distance matrix. To test whether vessels differ in color according to ColorGroup assignment, the color distance matrix was exported and joined with the categorical data. Those data were used in a permutational multivariate analysis of variance in the `vegan` package to evaluate whether vessel color differs by firing method (_permutations: 10,000; Rsq: 0.4342; **Pr(>F): 9.999e-05**_).

## Geography

Coordinate data were subsequently harvested and joined with the categorical dataset, and all data were imported to a GIS for a distribution analysis to identify core production areas. The GIS environment was modified to ensure that both distributions (oxidized and reduced) would share the same extent, defined by the distribution of all sites in the sample. The distribution of sites serves as a proxy for the distribution of the two types (Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain), where a minimum convex polygon could be fitted to those data as a means of delimiting their utilization distribution [sensu @RN11347]. Within that utilization distribution, core production areas were defined using kernel density, where raster values from the location of each site were subsequently exported to identify the 50 and 75 percent quantiles. Each raster was reclassified using three classifications; the darkest indicating the 50 percent quantile, another lighter color at 75, and a third---transparent---holding the remainder. Results demonstrate a single core area related to the production of reduced bottles; however, oxidized bottle production occurred across two core areas (one north; the other south). All core production areas occur in the Red River Basin inside the ancestral Caddo area.

## Morphology by Firing Method

To assess whether bottle morphology differed by method of firing, landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN8477;@RN7502;@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN11138;@RN478;@RN1646] in R using the `geomorph` and `RRPP` packages [@RN1655;@RN11775;@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. 

Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each bottle using unit-centroid size---the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid [@RN11139;@RN11140;@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN11141;@RN11142;@RN1646;@RN11563].

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualize shape variation among the bottles, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space [@RN8633;@RN5616;@RN11143;@RN7550]. Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference mesh [@RN1731;@RN479].

```{r fig4, fig.cap="Principal components analysis plot (PC1/PC2) for Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles by firing category, where gray circles indicate bottles fired in a reduced environment, and orange plus signs indicate those from an oxidized environment; warp grids for the first two principal components."}

knitr::include_graphics('./img/fig4.png')
```

To assess whether `shape` and `size` differs by `ColorGroup`, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719]. 

```{r fig5, fig.cap="Mean shapes summarizing variation in Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles fired in oxidized (left) and reduced (right) environments. In the comparison (center), gray spheres articulate with oxidized vessels, and black spheres with reduced."}

```

Results demonstrate a significant difference in size (_RRPP: 10,000; Rsq: 0.14223; **Pr(>F): 0.0373**_)---but not shape (_RRPP: 10,000; Rsq: 0.05789; **Pr(>F): 0.1652**)---by type, where the Hickory Engraved bottles were found to be larger than the Smithport Plain bottles. In the analysis of bottle morphology by firing method, vessels were found to differ in shape (_RRPP: 10,000; Rsq: 0.11456; **Pr(>F): 0.0275**_), but not size (_RRPP: 10,000; Rsq: 0.00224; **Pr(>F): 0.8008**_).

## Morphology by Core Production Area

To assess whether bottle morphology differed by core production area, the sample was filtered to include only those bottles from the three core production areas. Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualize shape variation among the bottles, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space [@RN8633;@RN5616;@RN11143;@RN7550]. Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference mesh [@RN1731;@RN479].

```{r fig6, fig.cap="Principal components analysis plot (PC1/PC2) for Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles by core production areas, where gray circles indicate reduced firing in the north, orange plus signs indicate oxidized firing in the south, and tan plus signs indicate oxidized firing in the north; warp grids for the first two principal components."}

To assess whether `shape` and `size` differs by `production area`, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719].

```

Results demonstrate no difference in the morphology of oxidized and reduced bottles recovered from sites in the two northern core production areas (_RRPP: 10,000; **Pr(>F): 0.9374**_). However, a significant difference in bottle shape exists between the northern and southern core production areas associated with oxidized firing (_RRPP: 10,000; **Pr(>F): 0.0031**_), and between the reduced (north) and southern core production areas (_RRPP: 10,000; **Pr(>F): 0.0003)**_).

## Summary of results

This study used a quantitative analysis of 3D vessel color to demarcate oxidized and reduced Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles, demonstrating a methodologically rigorous and reproducible approach to categorizing continuous variables associated with color. Bottles in each group were found to differ in shape, but not size, and while two core production areas are associated with oxidized firing, only one core production area was associated with reduction firing. While ancillary to the primary research question, a morphological comparison of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles was included in this analysis. Similarities in shape between the two types are known—and demonstrated here—however, what was not known is that Hickory Engraved bottles are significantly larger. This difference in volume may translate to a functional difference between the two bottle types. In concert, these findings provide evidence for two discrete, contemporary, and sympatric Caddo potting communities delimited by macroscopic production attributes, where differential production-based intentions among Caddo potters can be posited.

Using only those vessels recovered from sites in the core production areas, it was demonstrated that the oxidized and reduced bottles in the north are similar, and that the northern bottles differ significantly in shape when compared with bottles recovered in the south. Elsewhere it has been demonstrated that morphological differences exist between ceramics [@RN11801;@RN11782;@RN11716;@RN8312], bifaces [@RN21001;@RN11783], and arrow points [@RN11172;@RN11264;@RN9364] recovered from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions; a theory to which this effort contributes adds further support. These two communities of practice (morphology + firing) can be concatenated as a means of positing the possible provenance, or, at minimum, the locus of influence with regard to manufacture, associated with Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles found outside of the three core production areas identified above. In such cases, simple visual assessments of bottle shape can be used to discriminate between the northern and southern manufacturing traditions, while an assessment of firing method will discriminate---among the northern production areas---between eastern (reduced) and western (oxidized) firing traditions.

# Data management

Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918]. The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/seldenlab/hfesp.1](https://github.com/seldenlab/hfesp.1)), and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework ([DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/QC8D5](https://osf.io/qc8d5/)). The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN11783;@RN21001;@RN9364;@RN11264], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
