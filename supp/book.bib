   abstract = {Allometry refers to the size-related changes of morphological traits and remains an essential concept for the study of evolution and development. This review is the first systematic comparison of allometric methods in the context of geometric morphometrics that considers the structure of morphological spaces and their implications for characterizing allometry and performing size correction. The distinction of two main schools of thought is useful for understanding the differences and relationships between alternative methods for studying allometry. The Gould-Mosimann school defines allometry as the covariation of shape with size. This concept of allometry is implemented in geometric morphometrics through the multivariate regression of shape variables on a measure of size. In the Huxley-Jolicoeur school, allometry is the covariation among morphological features that all contain size information. In this framework, allometric trajectories are characterized by the first principal component, which is a line of best fit to the data points. In geometric morphometrics, this concept is implemented in analyses using either Procrustes form space or conformation space (the latter also known as size-and-shape space). Whereas these spaces differ substantially in their global structure, there are also close connections in their localized geometry. For the model of small isotropic variation of landmark positions, they are equivalent up to scaling. The methods differ in their emphasis and thus provide investigators with flexible tools to address specific questions concerning evolution and development, but all frameworks are logically compatible with each other and therefore unlikely to yield contradictory results.},

   abstract = {Character displacement is typically identified by comparing phenotypic differences in sympatry and allopatry. Recently, however, Goldberg and Lande (2006) pointed out that when phenotypic characters vary along an environmental gradient, the standard approach may fail to identify sympatric character divergence. Here we present a general analytical procedure for identifying sympatric character divergence while accounting for phenotypic changes that covary with environmental variables. Our approach uses residual randomization from a generalized linear model, and allows the statistical comparison of sympatric phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric character divergence when they are present, and does not identify such patterns when they are not. Our analytical approach complements and extends the suggestions of Goldberg and Lande (2006), by allowing a full statistical assessment of the varied patterns of character displacement along environmental gradients, or while accounting for other covariates and sources of variation.},

   abstract = {Analyses of two-state phenotypic change are common in ecological research. Some examples include phenotypic changes due to phenotypic plasticity between two environments, changes due to predator/non-predator character shifts, character displacement via competitive interactions, and patterns of sexual dimorphism. However, methods for analyzing phenotypic change for multivariate data have not been rigorously developed. Here we outline a method for testing vectors of phenotypic change in terms of two important attributes: the magnitude of change (vector length) and the direction of change described by trait covariation (angular difference between vectors). We describe a permutation procedure for testing these attributes, which allows non-targeted sources of variation to be held constant. We provide examples that illustrate the importance of considering vector attributes of phenotypic change in biological studies, and we demonstrate how greater inference can be made than by evaluating variance components with MANOVA alone. Finally, we consider how our method may be extended to more complex data.},

   abstract = {Many evolutionary studies require an understanding of phenotypic change. However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution. The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space. Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape), are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa, and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa. This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including: phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth, local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of Globorotalia.},

   abstract = {Biological color may be adaptive or incidental, seasonal or permanent, species- or population-specific, or modified for breeding, defense or camouflage. Although color is a hugely informative aspect of biology, quantitative color comparisons are notoriously difficult. Color comparison is limited by categorization methods, with available tools requiring either subjective classifications, or expensive equipment, software, and expertise. We present an R package for processing images of organisms (or other objects) in order to quantify color profiles, gather color trait data, and compare color palettes on the basis of color similarity and amount. The package treats image pixels as 3D coordinates in a "color space," producing a multidimensional color histogram for each image. Pairwise distances between histograms are computed using earth mover's distance, a technique borrowed from computer vision, that compares histograms using transportation costs. Users choose a color space, parameters for generating color histograms, and a pairwise comparison method to produce a color distance matrix for a set of images. The package is intended as a more rigorous alternative to subjective, manual digital image analyses, not as a replacement for more advanced techniques that rely on detailed spectrophotometry methods unavailable to many users. Here, we outline the basic functions of colordistance, provide guidelines for the available color spaces and quantification methods, and compare this toolkit with other available methods. The tools presented for quantitative color analysis may be applied to a broad range of questions in biology and other disciplines.},
